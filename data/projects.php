 * This file contains the $projects array used across the website
 * (e.g., in about.php) to display project listings.
 *
 * Each project is an associative array with the following fields:
 *
 *  - 'id'                A unique string identifier, used in URLs (e.g., project.php?id=XYZ).
 *  - 'title'             The name/title of your project (e.g., "Well/Informed").
 *  - 'short_description' A short teaser for the project (displayed in the gallery overlay).
 *  - 'long_description'  A more detailed overview shown on the project details page.
 *  - 'technologies'      A comma-separated list (or string) of the tech used.
 *  - 'live_link'         A URL if the project is viewable/live online.
 *  - 'category'          A label to group or filter projects (e.g., "websites", "art", "misc").
 *  - 'images'            An array of image file paths:
 *     â€¢ 'thumb'          Path to the thumbnail image used in the project gallery.
 *     â€¢ 'screenshots'    An array of full-size or additional screenshots for the project page.
 *
 * Example usage in about.php:
 *      foreach ($projects as $project) {
 *          echo $project['title'];
 *          // etc...
 *      }
 *
 * Adding a New Project:
 *   1. Create a new array item with all required fields (id, title, etc.).
 *   2. Ensure 'id' is unique.
 *   3. Set 'category' to one of the desired filters ("websites", "art", "misc"), or another if you prefer.
 *   4. Provide at least one thumbnail image in 'images' => ['thumb' => 'path/to/file'].
 *   5. (Optional) Add multiple screenshot paths in 'images' => ['screenshots' => [...]].
