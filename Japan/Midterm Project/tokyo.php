        <h2>Tokyo</h2>
        <p>The area now known as Tokyo was originally a small fishing village named Edo. It became the center of political power in the early 17th century when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his shogunate there, transforming Edo into one of the world's largest cities. In 1868, the Meiji Restoration saw the emperor move his residence from Kyoto to Edo, which was then renamed Tokyo, meaning "Eastern Capital." Since then, Tokyo has grown into one of the most populous and influential cities globally, overcoming challenges such as the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and the devastation of World War II.</p>
